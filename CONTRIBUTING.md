* Spend time learning with LinkedIn Learning, other contributors or online, if you are not comfortable or ready for your task.
* We divide tasks among us using [Trello](https://trello.com/b/4TERKed6/3-sem-obligatorisk-opgave-1).

## Taking on tasks
* Tasks can be found on [our Trello](https://trello.com/b/4TERKed6/3-sem-obligatorisk-opgave-1).
* When taking a task, you need to assign yourself to it on Trello, and move it to doing. If you are assigned to a task, you are responsible for moving it.
